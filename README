A first attempt to read .ddm (TODO, should be simple using
Config::Ini), .fdt (ongoing), and .bin files. These files seem to be
for Adabas, but I can't know for sure.

This project may or may not, depending on bandwith, and on achievement
of my primary goal : dump a few files for backup purpose.

Feel free to mail me at ymmv@free.fr for pull requests.
